Ghidra Program Analysis Library

Eventually -- hopefully -- this repository will contain a suite of program analysis-related plugins for Ghidra. I haven't written them yet. For now, there's a port of an abstract interpretation-based analysis that I use for deobfuscation and a binary upon which to test it.
